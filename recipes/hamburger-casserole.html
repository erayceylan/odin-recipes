        <h4>Description</h4>
        
        <p>This <em>quick and easy dinner</em> casserole is made with simple and cheap ingredients, takes very little time to prepare, and my entire family always goes back for seconds.</p>
        
        <p>Not only is it incredibly yummy, it also has a short and budget friendly shopping list: ground beef, pasta shells, tomato soup, cheese and seasoning to taste. I know, that doesn't sound like much, but when it all comes together it's like eating a cheeseburger out of a pan, which is very comforting especially in the cold winter months.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 box medium pasta shells</li>
            <li>250 gr ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar</li>
            <li>1 cups shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>seasoning to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>You'll start by cooking and draining the pasta according to the package directions.</li>
            <li>Next, brown the beef in a large skillet with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper. You could also throw in a diced onion if you'd like.</li>
            <li>Once the beef is brown, toss the pasta shells, tomato soup, a little water, and half of the cheese in with the beef, and then mix it all up.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into a large 9x13 greased baking dish. Top it with the remaining cheese and then bake covered with foil in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes to brown the cheese. I also like to turn the oven to broil for the last few minutes to make it a little toasty.</li>
        </ol>
